# Deep-Learning-Based-Breast-Tumor-Segmentation-in-Ultrasound-Images-Using-DeepLabV3-
This project uses DeepLabV3+ with a ResNet-101 backbone to segment breast tumors from ultrasound images. Trained on the BUSI dataset, it accurately identifies tumor regions, assisting radiologists in early detection and diagnosis of breast cancer through automated image analysis.
